# date-night
**YOU MUST ENABLE CROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING TO FIND A RESTAURANT

Project 1, deployed at: https://date-night-.herokuapp.com/index.html

Having a hard time with ideas for date night?  Use the new date night application to generate some great ideas for a night out with your significant other.

This app is designed to list events on a particular date by location.  You can then select from your list of event results to get a population of nearby restaurants and pubs.

In this application a Geolocation function can be used to automatically generate your location.  This location is then used to determine the nearby events and restaurants to select from.  

Conversely, one can input the City, and State to override the Geolocation.

This application uses GoogleLocation Api, Google Place Api, side Kick api, and one day maybe, the eventful API.
